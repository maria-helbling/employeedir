## Installation
  
This is a nodejs app, so needs the usual node installation steps of npm install and npm start.There is no need for a database connection to use this version of the code, however, to use this on a live database,t he connectivity to the database should be build.
  
## Usage
  
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have a quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It is particularly useful to be able to search for a colleague by name or sort them in alphabetical order.
